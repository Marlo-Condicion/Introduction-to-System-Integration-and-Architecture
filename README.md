# Introduction-to-System-Integration-and-Architecture

My expectation to this subject System Integration and Architecture is simple. I understand the topic will be challenging, but I see it as rewarding. I wish to learn more so that I may be better equipped for the future projects and work. I expect that the lessons shall not only challenge my concentration but also assist me in enhancing my technical proficiency in designing and administering systems.

I also hope to know how to make blueprints and diagrams that describe the way various components of a system interact. This skill is important because clear planning prevents problems when systems are put into practice. By learning this, I will be able to design processes that are organized and useful, which is something I can apply in both school and real projects.

I hope to receive support from our instructor to help make the lessons easier to follow. Through appropriate assistance, the topic will not be so overwhelming and will become more interesting. I wish to emerge from this course with enhanced problem-solving and system design capabilities, capabilities I recognize will serve me well in the future.
